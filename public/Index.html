<h1>The Best Movies in 2024 (so far in my opinion)</h1>
<h2>My top 3</h2>

<hr>

<ol>
    <li><h3>Wolverine and Deadpool</h3></li>
    Easily number one.Extremely mix between a serious hero and a joke of hero. The movie that helped Marvel regain their status back.  

    <li><h3>Despicable Me 4</h3></li>
    I mean come on its the minionsðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Extremely funny

    <li><h3>Kung Fu Panda 4</h3></li>
    Not as good as the first 3 movies but but still makes it into my top 3.
